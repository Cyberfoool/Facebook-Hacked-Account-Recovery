**Recovery methods for small and medium businesses on social media**

**Project Overview**
Welcome to the repository for my Master of Cyber Security thesis, "Recovery methods for small and medium businesses on social media" 

This project addresses a critical and often overlooked challenge for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs): how to quickly and effectively recover compromised social media accounts. In today's digital landscape, social media platforms are indispensable tools for SMBs to connect with customers and drive sales.  However, this reliance also exposes them to significant cyberattack risks, with account takeovers affecting over 100,000 accounts in 2023 alone.  These breaches can lead to substantial financial losses (estimated at $25,000 per incident) and severe operational disruptions due to slow and inadequate platform recovery processes. 



My thesis introduces a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)-based framework tailored specifically for SMBs.  By adapting established BCDR principles to the social media context, this research offers a novel, user-centric approach to rapid and trustworthy account recovery, empowering SMBs to mitigate disruptions efficiently. 


**The Problem: A Critical Gap in Security**
Current cybersecurity research predominantly focuses on preventing breaches (e.g., password security, phishing detection). However, there's a significant gap: less than 15% of surveyed literature addresses effective post-breach recovery workflows.  Existing platform recovery mechanisms are often slow and fail to meet SMBs' critical Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) of less than 72 hours.  This leaves SMBs, often lacking advanced technical expertise and financial resources, vulnerable to prolonged downtime and severe consequences. 





**The Solution: A BCDR Framework for Recovery**
My thesis bridges this critical gap by developing a comprehensive BCDR framework for social media account recovery.  This framework provides a two-pronged approach:

Immediate Recovery Strategies: Rapid account restoration and follower re-engagement. 
Long-Term Preventative Measures: Including content backup protocols and threat mitigation. 
The goal is to deliver practical, easy-to-implement solutions for SMBs to regain control swiftly and enhance future resilience.  Initially focused on major Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram),  the framework offers a scalable alternative to platform-dependent recovery. 



**Key Findings: Recovery Scenarios & Effectiveness**
The research systematically investigated three distinct scenarios of social media account compromise to assess recovery feasibility and effectiveness:

**Scenario 1: Contact Info Intact, No MFA Applied**

Outcome: Highly successful, with a 95% success rate and recovery in under 24 hours. 
Insight: Highlights the efficiency of basic password reset methods when foundational contact details are uncompromised, but also the vulnerability due to lack of MFA. 

**Scenario 2: Contact Info Intact, MFA Applied**

Outcome: Respectable 80-90% success rate, but recovery times extended to 1-2 days. 
Insight: MFA complicates recovery (e.g., requires adding new contact methods, submitting ID to bypass attacker's MFA), necessitating adaptive strategies. 

**Scenario 3: Contact Info Deleted, MFA Status Varies**

Outcome: Most challenging, with 60-70% success rates and recovery times stretching to 1-3 weeks. 
Insight: This worst-case scenario exposes severe vulnerabilities and highlights the critical need for proactive preparation (e.g., trusted contacts, ID verification). 
Supplementary Recovery Methods Tested in Scenario 3:

Public Data Backup Tools (e.g., Apify): Crucial for preserving public content (posts, images, videos), acting as damage mitigation rather than direct access restoration. 
Lockout Tactics (e.g., repeated failed logins): Disrupted attacker control in 65-75% of cases by triggering platform security protocols. 
Device Mimicry: Low success rate (around 30%) due to technical complexity and limited effectiveness without contact info. 
Instagram-Backchannel via Meta Verified: A standout solution, achieving up to 85% success for subscribers by providing direct access to human support agents.  This highlights the value of personalized assistance, despite its cost. 

Post-Recovery Security Measures
Regaining access is just the first step. The framework emphasizes crucial post-recovery security measures to prevent re-compromise:

Reset Password: To a strong, unique one. 
Reconfigure 2FA: Using authenticator apps for enhanced security. 
Audit Account Settings: To remove any unauthorized changes. 
Backup Account Data: For future protection and digital preservation. 
Future Work & Recommendations
The field of social media security is dynamic, and my thesis identifies several promising avenues for future research and development:

Platform Expansion: Extend the framework to include other major platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and TikTok, considering their unique features and recovery processes. 
Cost-Effective Solutions: Explore more affordable and accessible recovery methods, such as open-source tools or community-based support, to cater to resource-constrained SMBs. 
AI Integration: Investigate low-complexity, user-friendly AI tools for real-time threat detection and automated response that SMBs can easily adopt. 

Industry Collaboration: Foster structured partnerships with cybersecurity and legal professionals to enhance recovery strategies, compliance, and incident response. 
User Training & Long-term Evaluation: Develop accessible training modules and conduct continuous monitoring of the framework's performance in real-world environments. 

**Why This Matters**
This thesis offers a critical lifeline for SMBs, who are increasingly reliant on social media for their operations but often lack the robust defenses of larger enterprises.  By providing practical, business-centric recovery solutions, this work aims to empower SMBs to swiftly overcome cyber incidents, ensuring sustained customer engagement and revenue generation in an increasingly perilous digital landscape.
